## Effective development aid

One of the greatest global problems is poverty.
Millions of people in developing countries are plagued by dangerous diseases,
low economical productivity and systematic destruction of the environment.

## What will the future be like? How can we secure a better world for future generations?

The world is undergoing an unprecedented period of accelerating technological
and economical growth. Will the current trajectory lead to a blossoming
civilization and a utopian future, or are we headed for overpopulation,
destructive climate change, or even global thermonuclear war?

## How to choose the right career to help the world?

We spend an enormous part of our lives at work. That is why
career selection is so important - by choosing a socially beneficial career,
one can have a huge positive impact. Well, how does one choose?

<p>
David realized that making social businesses was hard, and a potentially higher-leverage strategy might be to make it easier for people who were founding successful technology businesses to commit to donating the money they would eventually earn. He says that the ideas of effective altruism (that he first encountered in Peter Singer's TED talk), earning to give, and the work of 80,000 Hours in particular, was influential to his thinking and his decision to choose this route.

## Dysrationalia - Why Smart People Do Stupid Things?

In his talk, <i>Lucius Caviola</i> will explain that IQ tests don't measure
the amount of rational thinking and decision correctly.
Studies show that a correlation between IQ and a hypothetical "coefficient of rationality"
is weaker than one would expect. Better understanding to rational thinking
can help us to improve rationality itself, which is a necessary ability to
reach our personal and even moral goals.

# Goals

The goal of our conference is to inform the Czech public about how can

our actions in an *effective* manner. In other words: how to accomplish
*the most good with as little resources expended as possible*.
