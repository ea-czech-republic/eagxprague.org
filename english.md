# Program

## Introduction to Effective Altruism

Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement with the goal of
making the world as good as possible as effectively as possible through
reason and scientific thinking.
But why is effective altruism a good idea? What does it mean, to actually <i>be
an effective altruist</i>?

<p>
<i>Aleš Flídr</i> is an Economics student at Harvard University. In his second year he was a co-president of the Harvard Effective Altruism Club. He worked as an intern in the Centre for Effective Altruism in Oxford. His interests include behavioural economics and philosophy.</p>
</div>
</div>

## Effective development aid

One of the greatest global problems is poverty.
Millions of people in developing countries are plagued by dangerous diseases,
low economical productivity and systematic destruction of the environment.

innovations in global health and development.
<br>
Alix has worked at the intersection of the evidence and innovation agendas
from a diverse set of posts. She was the first employee and Executive
Director at Evidence Action, a non-profit that develops service delivery
models to scale evidence-based programs. Under Alix’s leadership, Evidence
Action catalyzed school-based deworming for hundreds of millions of
children, and safe drinking water for millions of people in four countries.
Alix has also advocated for evidence-based philanthropy at the Gates
Foundation and Google.org. She designed and developed strategy to support
new public service models that work for the poor.
<br>

## What will the future be like? How can we secure a better world for future generations?

The world is undergoing an unprecedented period of accelerating technological
and economical growth. Will the current trajectory lead to a blossoming
civilization and a utopian future, or are we headed for overpopulation,
destructive climate change, or even global thermonuclear war?

## How to choose the right career to help the world?

We spend an enormous part of our lives at work. That is why
career selection is so important - by choosing a socially beneficial career,
one can have a huge positive impact. Well, how does one choose?
The enormously important issue of <b>career selection</b> will be explored
by <i>David Goldberg</i>

<div class="speaker">
<img src="images/speakers/david-goldberg.jpg"
	style="width: 180px;" >
<div class="desc">
<p>
David realized that making social businesses was hard, and a potentially
higher-leverage strategy might be to make it easier for people who were
founding successful technology businesses to commit to donating the money they
would eventually earn. He says that the ideas of effective altruism (that he
first encountered in Peter Singer's TED talk), earning to give, and the work
of 80,000 Hours in particular, was influential to his thinking and his decision
to choose this route. He founded the Founders Forum for Good, which runs the
<a href="https://founderspledge.com/">Founder's Pledge</a> program that
commits startup founders to commit 2% of their personal proceeds from exit to the high impact causes they care about. Founders Pledge's total pledge valuation now exceeds <i>$186 000 000</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

## Dysrationalia - Why smart people so stupid things

In his talk, <i>Lucius Caviola</i> will explain that IQ tests don't measure
the amount of rational thinking and decision correctly.
Studies show that a correlation between IQ and a hypothetical "coefficient of rationality"
is weaker than one would expect. Better understanding to rational thinking
can help us to improve rationality itself, which is a necessary ability to
reach our personal and even moral goals.

<i>Lucius Caviola</i> is co-founder of the Effective Altruism Foundation (EAF) and coordinates their outreach activities. He studied psychology at the universities of Basel and Oxford and researches in cognitive and moral psychology at the Department for Experimental Psychology and the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford.
</p>
</div>
</div>

## How can students help the world?

<i>Ollie Base</i> works for <a href="http://www.shicschools.org/">Students for High-Impact Charity</a>. 
In his talk, he will present their vision and approaches, how students can help the world. 

<div class="speaker">

<i>Ollie Base</i> is a third year Philosophy with Psychology student, currently studying in Cologne, Germany. Last year, he was president of Effective Altruism Society Warwick and is currently founding a chapter in Cologne. Ollie was on the team which compiled the SHIC curriculum and continues to volunteer remotely on the subject
