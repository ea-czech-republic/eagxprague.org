# Program

## Introduction to Effective Altruism

Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement with the goal of
making the world as good as possible as effectively as possible through
reason and scientific thinking.
But why is effective altruism a good idea? What does it mean, to actually <i>be
an effective altruist</i>?

of Oxford. Radim has been engaged in the Effective Altruism movement since high
school and co-founded the Czech Association for Effective Altruism.

## Effective development aid

One of the greatest global problems is poverty.
Millions of people in developing countries are plagued by dangerous diseases,
low economical productivity and systematic destruction of the environment.

## What will the future be like? How can we secure a better world for future generations?

The world is undergoing an unprecedented period of accelerating technological
and economical growth. Will the current trajectory lead to a blossoming
civilization and a utopian future, or are we headed for overpopulation,
destructive climate change, or even global thermonuclear war?

## How to choose the right career to help the world?

We spend an enormous part of our lives at work. That is why
career selection is so important - by choosing a socially beneficial career,
one can have a huge positive impact. Well, how does one choose?
The enormously important issue of <b>career selection</b> will be explored
by <i>David Goldberg</i>

<div class="desc">
<p>
David realized that making social businesses was hard, and a potentially
higher-leverage strategy might be to make it easier for people who were
founding successful technology businesses to commit to donating the money they
would eventually earn. He says that the ideas of effective altruism (that he
first encountered in Peter Singer's TED talk), earning to give, and the work
of 80,000 Hours in particular, was influential to his thinking and his decision
to choose this route. He founded the Founders Forum for Good, which runs the
<a href="https://founderspledge.com/">Founder's Pledge</a> program that
commits startup founders to commit 2% of their personal proceeds from exit to the high impact causes they care about. Founders Pledge's total pledge valuation now exceeds <i>$186 000 000</i>.

## Dysrationalia - Why smart people so stupid things

In his talk, <i>Lucius Caviola</i> will explain that IQ tests don't measure
the amount of rational thinking and decision correctly.
Studies show that a correlation between IQ and a hypothetical "coefficient of rationality"
is weaker than one would expect. Better understanding to rational thinking
can help us to improve rationality itself, which is a necessary ability to
reach our personal and even moral goals.
