# Program

## How to choose the right career to help the world?

We spent an enormous part of our lives in a work. That is the reason why
 the career selection is so important. Well, how to choose?

David realized that making social businesses was hard, and a potentially higher-leverage strategy might be to make it easier for people who were founding successful technology businesses to commit to donating the money they would eventually earn. He says that the ideas of effective altruism (that he first encountered in Peter Singer's TED talk), earning to give, and the work of 80,000 Hours in particular, was influential to his thinking and his decision to choose this route.

## Dysrationalia - Why Smart People Do Stupid Things?

In his talk <i>Lucius Caviola</i> explains, that IQ tests don't measure 
the amount of rational thinking and decision correctly. 
Studies show that a correlation between IQ and hypothetic "coefficient of rationality"
is weaker, than one would expect. Better understanding to rational thinking
can help us to improve rationality itself, which is a necessary ability to 
reach our personal and even moral goals.
